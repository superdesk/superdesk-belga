                <body>According to the US Department of Defense, there have been indications in Ukraine that Ukrainians have been forcibly deported to Russia. John Kirby, a spokesman for the Pentagon, spoke about the matter.Kirby did not tell reporters how many possible Ukrainian camps are being talked about. However, according to Kirby, there is evidence that the Ukrainians were transported to Russia against their will.Moscow has had 75 days to treat Ukrainians cruelly. Every time you think they can’t sink even lower anymore, they prove you’re wrong, Kirby said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi said as early as April that thousands of Ukrainians would have been deported to Russia. According to Ukrainian Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova, the number of Ukrainians deported to Russia would have risen to more than 1.19 million since the start of the war. The figure includes at least 200,000 children.</body>
